# Reduced-Transfer-Entropy
Implements reduced transfer entropy measure from "Transfer entropy for finite data". Allows for automatic model selection for correlated time series pairs through the MDL principle.

See example_usage.ipynb for an example script implementing the method, and RTE.py for source code.
